# castanedaPRestaurantPickerEndpoint

Created an endpoint which calls a function that randomly picks a restaurant from a food category the user chooses.

User will input a category of food (european, american, asian, latin) and a random restaurant based on the category they chose will be recommended to them. The output will be seen in the postman console.
